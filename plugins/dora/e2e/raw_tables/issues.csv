It may cause request to fail because of a network error when collecting data, and then DevLake needs to take lots of time to restart collection several times if the network is instability.\r\n\r\nConsecutive retry cannot handle this situation because network instability may exist for several seconds.\r\n\r\nSo, I prefer to add another retry function to handle this situation. \r\nIt will stop other workers and request base endpoint to confirm if the network is ok. This network retry function will request base endpoint immediately after other worker fails more than 3 times.

Calls to this function must be done where the given \""err\"" is not going to be returned back to the caller. Otherwise we keep spamming the logs with the same error over and over. Another use-case is when a parent logger creates a child logger using logger.Nested(). If an error happens at the child level, the function that created the child should print the error and not pass it up to the parent logger.\r\n\r\n### Use case\r\n\r\nTo summarize the description:\r\n1. logger.Error(err, msg) with err != nil should be called when the err is not being returned to the caller\r\n2. logger.Error(err, msg) with err != nil should be called at functions that create that logger. That err must not be returned back to the caller, but it's ok to create a new, non-wrapped error and pass that to the caller.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, logger.Error with err != nil should not be called because it'll lead to confusing and spammy log messages.\r\n\r\n### Related issues\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)\r\n""","",INCIDENT,TODO,"",0,,2022-09-14 09:19:18,2022-09-14 09:19:36,0,"","",0,0,0,github:GithubAccount:1:25063936,keon94,github:GithubAccount:1:0,"","","",""
